As are the heated seats and steering wheel, especially here in the arctic. So give it a test drive and see what you think. I believe they are also giving away a lifetime supply of candy corn, but only if you know phrase taught by the Leprechauns, so maybe not available to non-Faeriefolk. Either way it is a bang up browser that is sure to get you where you need to go. \nBut be aware that a secure internet connection feels different than IE or Chrome. Don't expect an uparmoured Humvee with it's MK19 grenade launcher and anti-missile/anti-dragon* systems to ride exactly like an unarmoured Porsche. Brave gets you boldly and courageously to the place you want to be with no tag-alongs, spies, or Lizard People giving you a hard time, whilst Chrome and IE get you there too, and usually much faster, but are always accompanied by an army of bots, trackers, spies, and of course, Lizard People who ensure that they will also fail to work on some computers, and that you are never alone. Never....never ever!!\n\nThat said Brave has easy VPN and TOR integration too, so maybe you can avoid getting yourself on an NSA list** you crazy scoundrel you! \nWell that's enough from me, gotta get out there and shovel 3 feet of snow to make room for the additional foot coming this evening.\n\n*actual dragons, some are okay, but most just cannot resist shooting fire at you when they see you, and trying to carry away your dog for a snack.\n**NONE ESCAPE THE EYES OF THE NSA!!
